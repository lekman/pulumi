# Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Model

The DSL file contains the business objects, actors and software systems used within an integration. It can also contain several different views of the system.

The documentation follows the [C4 model](https://c4model.com), where we render level 1 to 3.

Render the .dsl file using the [Structurizr DSL editor](https://structurizr.com/dsl) and export as .png files.
