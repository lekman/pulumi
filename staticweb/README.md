Based on Pulumi example: [AWS TS Static Website](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/aws-ts-static-website).

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
1. [Deployment](#deployment)

## Prerequisites

If Pulumi is already installed and can deploy to AWS, skip these steps. If not, install Pulumi:

```bash
brew install pulumi
```

If you are on Apple Silicon, then adjust (also in every **brew** command later on) as

```bash
arch --arm64 brew install pulumi
```

If you get version warnings, simply update Pulumi as:

```bash
brew upgrade pulumi
```

Verify installation:

```bash
$ pulumi version
v3.13.2
```

Esure you are logged in to Pulumi:

```bash
pulumi login
```

If not, follow instructions to authorize.

Then, use nvm to switch to latest stable LTS version of node.

```bash
$ brew install nvm
...
Type `nvm help` for further information.

[Connect AWS and Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/aws/begin/) by:

1. Go to AWS IAM in the management console as ROOT
1. Create account (pulumi_svc) as access keys type and add to AdministratorsAccess group
1. Copy key/secret

The xCode tools intallation below takes a considerable time. Use the key/secret values after running the **aws configure** command.

```bash
xcode-select ‚Äîinstall
brew install awscli
aws configure
touch ~/.aws/credentials; open ~/.aws/credentials
```

You should see the AWS configuration file. Verify and close TextEdit.

## Deployment

Move to the repo folder and run:

```bash
$ pulumi stack init dev
Created stack 'dev'
$ pulumi stack select dev

$ npm install
...
